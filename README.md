## My process

• Reorganized base code to my (beginner) preferences.
• Injected an external CSS Style sheet and linked it
• Created a single section (#) to put eveyrthing in
• Created a container div for the qrcode and the text to go in
• Adjusted to match style sheet
• Created alternate style with media queries for responsiveness with mobile


### Built with

• HTML
• CSS

### What I learned

This code was actually the first time media queries really clicked for me.
Even though it might seem horrible to the expert eye, I feel really joyful just seeing this kind of work !

### Continued development

I would really like to understand more about responsiveness, and how to easily and efficiently adapt my creations to multiple sizes.
